#slide[
  = Why
  
  - A beginner friendly topic
  - I love them

#new-section[Definiton Time]

#slide[
  = CLI Project
  
  Application, TUI, Script, Job, Watcher
  
]

#slide[
  = Let us try
  
  Anything that does not have a UI
  
]

#slide[
  = Let us try
  
  Anything that we can run on the command line
  
]

#slide[
  = Wikipedia

   A command-line interface (CLI) is a means of interacting with software via commands ‚Äì each formatted as a line of text. 
  
]


#slide[
  = Let us try

  Anything that we can drive via the command line
  
]


#new-section[First Lesson]

#slide[
  = What are we actually doing?
  
  - Are we working with existing data?
  - Do we need reports for the Business or Customer?
  - Is the Output easy to read?
  - Is the Input easy to input?
  
]

#slide[
  = What are we actually doing?
  
  - Are we calling an API?
  - Do we have a long running process?
  - Are there prerequisites?
  - What happens if we fail?
  
]

#slide[
  = The (non-Rust) lesson (experience)
  
  - Think about the problem
  - Sketch it out quickly
  - Sketch out the whole flow
  - Do not design the implementation
  
]


#slide[
  = Example
  
  - from my experience
  
]   

#slide[
  = Further listening
  
  - Hammock Driven Development - Rich Hickey 
  
]


#new-section[Second Lesson]

#slide[
  = Install
  https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started
  ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```
]

#slide[
  = Init
  
  ```bash
  cargo init mycli
  ```
]

#slide[
  = Run
  
  ```bash
  cargo run
  ```
]

#slide[
  = The lesson (opinion)
  
  - If you goal is learning, start always with this as your first code
  
]

#new-section[Third Lesson]

#slide[
  = CLI Arguments
  
```rust
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();
    dbg!(args);
}
```
]

#slide[
  = Install in local
  
```bash
    cargo install --path .
```
]

#slide[
  = Install in local
  
```bash
    mycli
```
]

#slide[
  = little trick for local development
  
```bash
    cargo run -- <args>
```
]

#slide[
  = The lesson
  
Use the tools rust gives you

#new-section[Fourth Lesson]

#slide[
  = Simple CLI Structure
  
i -> l -> o 

input -> logic -> output

]

#slide[
  = Simple error handling
  
i || e -> l || e -> o || e 

e -> o

error -> output

]

#slide[
  = error collecting
  
i && e -> l && e -> o && e 

if e -> o

]

#slide[
  = collecting error/warnings

#slide[
  = CLI Structure in rust
  
  - Small white board session and demo
  - Demo mycli
  
]


#slide[
  = The lesson (experience)
  
  - Do not share logic
  - Share the output to not break the api
  - Share the input code to not break the api
