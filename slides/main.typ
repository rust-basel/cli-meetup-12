#slide[
  = Why
  
  - A beginner friendly topic
  - I love them

#new-section[Definiton Time]

#slide[
  = CLI Project
  
  Application, TUI, Script, Job, Watcher
  
]

#slide[
  = Let us try
  
  Anything that does not have a UI
  
]

#slide[
  = Let us try
  
  Anything that we can run on the command line
  
]

#slide[
  = Let us try

  Anything that we drive via the command line

#new-section[First Lesson]

#slide[
  = What are we actually doing?
  
  - Are we working with existing data?
  - Do we need reports for the Business or Customer?

]

#slide[
  = What are we actually doing?
  
  - Are we calling an API?
  - Do we have a long running process?
  - Are there prerequisites?
  - What happens if we fail?
  
]

#slide[
  = The (non-Rust) lesson
  
  - Think about the problem
  - Sketch it out quickly
  - Sketch out the whole flow
  - Do not design the implementation
  
]


#slide[
  = Example
  
  - from my experience
